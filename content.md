# Testing your code
Testing is a critical skill in software development. It helps ensure your code works as expected and remains reliable as it evolves. In this lesson, we'll start by discussing the fundamentals of software testing, starting with how to gather and write functional requirements. Then, we'll introduce the [`MiniTest`](https://github.com/minitest/minitest) gem to write our first unit tests.

## The Importance of Testing
Before diving into specific tools and techniques, it's essential to understand why testing is crucial:

- **Quality Assurance**: Testing helps ensure the software meets the desired quality standards, reducing bugs and enhancing user satisfaction.
- **Reliability**: By catching issues early, testing ensures that the software remains stable and reliable over time.
- **Maintainability**: Well-tested code is easier to maintain and extend because tests provide a safety net for changes.
- **Efficiency**: Automated tests can save time and effort compared to manual testing.

## Gathering Requirements
The first step in any software development process is gathering requirements. This involves understanding what the users and stakeholders need from the software. Requirements can be divided into two categories:

- **Functional Requirements**: Define what the software should do. These are typically written in the form of user stories.
- **Technical Requirements**: Sometimes called "Non-Functional Requirements", define how the software should perform, including aspects like security, usability, and performance.

## Writing Functional Requirements with User Stories
User stories are simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. A typical user story format is:

> "As a [role], I want to be able to [capability], so that [benefit]."

### Example User Story
"As a user of a calculator application, I want to be able to add two numbers, so that I can see the sum."

User stories are the foundation for writing tests because they describe the expected behavior of the software from the user's perspective.

<!-- TODO: add example functional spec with user stories for the calculator cli app -->
### Example Functional Requirements Document

```md
# Calculator CLI Functional Specification
The Calculator CLI app provides users with a simple, command-line interface to perform basic arithmetic operations.

## User Stories

### Basic Operations
- As a user, I want to add two numbers, so that I can calculate their sum.
- As a user, I want to subtract one number from another, so that I can calculate the difference.


### Continuous Operations
- As a user, I want to perform multiple calculations without restarting the application, so that I can use the calculator efficiently.

### Functional Requirements
- The calculator must prompt the user for an operation (addition and subtraction).
- The calculator must prompt the user for two numbers to perform the operation on.
- The calculator must display the result of the operation.
- The calculator must handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., non-numeric input).
- The calculator must allow the user to perform another calculation after one completes.
```

## What is Unit Testing?
Unit testing involves writing automated tests for small, isolated parts of your application, typically individual methods or functions. These tests validate that your code behaves as expected under various conditions. You know all those tests you've been running to get full credit on the Ruby assignments? Those are unit tests in action!

## Why MiniTest?
[`MiniTest`](https://github.com/minitest/minitest) is a simple yet powerful testing framework that comes bundled with Ruby. It's great for beginners due to its straightforward syntax and minimal setup.

## Setting Up a MiniTest Project
- Create a new directory for your project. You may want to create a new repository from the [Ruby Sandbox](https://github.com/new?template_name=ruby-sandbox&template_owner=appdev-projects) named something like `minitest-calculator` and open up a codespace.
- Inside this directory, create two files: `calculator.rb` (our code) and `tests/test_calculator.rb` (our tests). It's a standard practice to keep your test files organized inside a `tests` directory.

## Writing Our First Ruby Class
Let's start by writing a simple Ruby class in `calculator.rb`:

```ruby
# calculator.rb

class Calculator
  def add(a, b)
    a + b
  end
end

```

## Bringing in the MiniTest gem
Refresh your memory from the [previous lesson where we learned about gems](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/80-ruby-intro-running-real-programs#gems). Before we can start using `minitest` in our codespace, we need to either:

Run this at the bash prompt in your terminal:

```
gem install minitest
```

_or_, the better idea is to create a new `Gemfile` in your file explorer, and fill it with:

<aside>

As an alternative to manually creating the `Gemfile`, try to run the command `bundle init` in your terminal at the bash prompt. This command will create a new `Gemfile` and add the `source` line at the top to avoid any typos!
</aside>

```rb
# Gemfile

source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "minitest"
```

Then, [run `bundle install` at the bash prompt](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/80-ruby-intro-running-real-programs#bundler), which will install the gem and create a `Gemfile.lock` for you to keep track of the gem version!

- Did you add a `Gemfile`, fill it in, run `bundle install`, and make a git commit to take a snapshot of your new `Gemfile.lock`?
- Yes.
  - Great! Carry on then.
- Not yet.
  - Please do so before you proceed.

## Writing Tests with MiniTest
Now that we have the gem installed, we'll write tests for our Calculator class in `tests/test_calculator.rb`:

```ruby
# tests/test_calculator.rb

require 'minitest/autorun'
require './calculator'

class TestCalculator < Minitest::Test
  def test_addition
    calculator = Calculator.new
    assert_equal 4, calculator.add(2, 2), "Addition method failed"
  end
end
```

## Understanding the Test Code
- `require 'minitest/autorun'`: This line loads the MiniTest framework, which we `bundle install`ed to make it available in our codespace.
- `require './calculator'`: This line loads our Calculator class.
- `class TestCalculator < Minitest::Test`: We define a test class that inherits from Minitest::Test.
- `def test_addition`: Our first test method. In `MiniTest`, any method that begins with `test_` is automatically run as a test.
- `assert_equal 4, calculator.add(2, 2)`: The assertion. We're checking if the add method returns 4 when given 2 and 2.

## Running the Tests
Run your tests with the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ruby tests/test_calculator.rb
```

You should see output indicating that 1 test has been run and passed.

```bash
Run options: --seed 23211

# Running:

.

Finished in 0.001780s, 561.9101 runs/s, 561.9101 assertions/s.

1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

## Expanding Our Tests
Let's add more functionality to our Calculator class and test it:

```ruby
# calculator.rb

class Calculator
  def add(a, b)
    a + b
  end

  def subtract(a, b)
    a - b
  end
end
```

And the corresponding test:

```ruby
# tests/test_calculator.rb

# ... existing code ...

  def test_subtraction
    calculator = Calculator.new
    assert_equal 0, calculator.subtract(2, 2), "Subtraction method failed"
  end
end
```

Run your tests again to see both tests pass.

```bash
Run options: --seed 10737

# Running:

..

Finished in 0.001611s, 1241.2554 runs/s, 1241.2554 assertions/s.

2 runs, 2 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

## Test Driven Development (TDD)
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where you write tests before the actual code. This can be a beneficial approach when dealing with highly complex business logic or when refactoring a large codebase to make sure you don't break anything ðŸ˜…. This approach might be overkill for many small projects or prototypes that are constantly changing.
