# Testing your code with `MiniTest`
Testing is a critical skill in software development. It helps ensure your code works as expected and remains reliable as it evolves. In this lesson, we'll introduce [`MiniTest`](https://github.com/minitest/minitest), a testing framework incldued with Ruby, to write our first unit tests.

## What is Unit Testing?
Unit testing involves writing automated tests for small, isolated parts of your application, typically individual methods or functions. These tests validate that your code behaves as expected under various conditions. You know all those tests you've been running to get full credit on the Ruby assignments? Those are unit tests in action!

## Why [`MiniTest`](https://github.com/minitest/minitest)?
[`MiniTest`](https://github.com/minitest/minitest) is a simple yet powerful testing framework that comes bundled with Ruby. It's great for beginners due to its straightforward syntax and minimal setup.

## Setting Up a [`MiniTest`](https://github.com/minitest/minitest) Project
- Create a new directory for your project. You may want to create a new repository from the [Ruby Sandbox](https://github.com/new?template_name=ruby-sandbox&template_owner=appdev-projects) named something like `minitest-calculator` and open up a codespace.
- Inside this directory, create two files: `calculator.rb` (our code) and `tests/test_calculator.rb` (our tests). It's a standard practice to keep your test files organized inside a `tests` directory.

## Writing Our First Ruby Class
Let's start by writing a simple Ruby class in calculator.rb:

```ruby
# calculator.rb

class Calculator
  def add(a, b)
    a + b
  end
end

```

## Writing Tests with [`MiniTest`](https://github.com/minitest/minitest)
Now, we'll write tests for our Calculator class in test_calculator.rb:

```ruby
# tests/test_calculator.rb

require 'minitest/autorun'
require './calculator'

class TestCalculator < Minitest::Test
  def test_addition
    calculator = Calculator.new
    assert_equal 4, calculator.add(2, 2), "Addition method failed"
  end
end
```

## Understanding the Test Code
- `require 'minitest/autorun'`: This line loads the MiniTest framework.
- `require './calculator'`: This line loads our Calculator class.
- `class TestCalculator < Minitest::Test`: We define a test class that inherits from Minitest::Test.
- `def test_addition`: Our first test method. In `MiniTest`, any method that begins with `test_` is automatically run as a test.
- `assert_equal 4, calculator.add(2, 2)`: The assertion. We're checking if the add method returns 4 when given 2 and 2.

## Running the Tests
Run your tests with the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ruby tests/test_calculator.rb
```

You should see output indicating that 1 test has been run and passed.

```bash
Run options: --seed 23211

# Running:

.

Finished in 0.001780s, 561.9101 runs/s, 561.9101 assertions/s.

1 runs, 1 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

## Expanding Our Tests
Let's add more functionality to our Calculator class and test it:

```ruby
# calculator.rb

class Calculator
  def add(a, b)
    a + b
  end

  def subtract(a, b)
    a - b
  end
end
```

And the corresponding test:

```ruby
# tests/test_calculator.rb

# ... existing code ...

  def test_subtraction
    calculator = Calculator.new
    assert_equal 0, calculator.subtract(2, 2), "Subtraction method failed"
  end
end
```

Run your tests again to see both tests pass.

```bash
Run options: --seed 10737

# Running:

..

Finished in 0.001611s, 1241.2554 runs/s, 1241.2554 assertions/s.

2 runs, 2 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

## Test Driven Development (TDD)
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where you write tests before the actual code. This can be a beneficial approach when dealing with highly complex business logic or when refactoring a large codebase to make sure you don't break anything ðŸ˜…. This approach might be overkill for many small projects or prototypes that are constantly changing.


## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've just written your first unit tests in Ruby using [`MiniTest`](https://github.com/minitest/minitest). This is just the beginning. As you write more complex Ruby programs, your tests will become an invaluable tool to ensure your code remains correct and maintainable.
